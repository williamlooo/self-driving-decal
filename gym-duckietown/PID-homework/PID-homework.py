    This function is called at every frame to handle
    movement/stepping and redrawing. It is where you will have your control
    logic. Thus you should only have to edit the PID class and this update function.

    You do not need to worry about the dt input to this function. If you look below,
    pyglet is scheduled to call update once for each frame (at the same rate as the environment
    frame rate). In the PID function, this is why we define delT as such as the frame rate is 30 fps.

    e_p is the cross track error as measured by the environment. It will be positive on one side of the track
    (right) and negative on the other side (left). This is the error signal passed to the PID

    We have included all the logic needed to create the running environment except a steering command.
    You could put in a random steering command and start the environment if you want to see.

    However, this steer value should come from a PID controller you define outside of the update function
    (so it is not reinitialized and you lose prior useful values). We have given you a starting velocity of
    .1 which is very slow. Try to tweak the three parameters of your PID so that you can complete one loop
    of the environment at a speed greater than or equal to .3
